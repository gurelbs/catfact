# [App Demo](https://catfact.cf/)

## Installation

### run the app localy:

clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gurelbs/catfact.git
```

then run:

```bash
cd catfact
npm i && npm i --prefix client
npm run dev
```

### noted:

this repository does not contain the necessary .env file, the DB connection probably won't work, but the client should work fine.
